# DSS
It runs now, but has fixed values as well as no calculation for the index itself. Will be fixed soon!!

This is a decision support system to decide if a task should be done or not. 
The variables based on which the DG Index is calculated are the due date and the task importance.
DG Index = Decision Grading Index is a number between 0 and 1.
